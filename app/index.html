            <h2>Confectionary today: short &amp; sweet</h2>
            <p>Confectionary, sweet biscuits and snacks are on the upswing. Over the next five years, the European confectionery
                market will grow by 19%.
                <br> At the same time, the importance of packaging has taken flight. Individually wrapped candies in a stand-up
                pouch are trending, while re-sealable packaging gives consumers more control.

            <h2>Streamline your in-store operations</h2>
            <h3>80% of success is showing up</h3>
            <p>Point-of-purchase marketing makes a huge difference in sales – especially in confectionary. But without easy-to-use
                packaging, your product likely won’t make it to the storefront, let alone your customers’ shopping baskets.</p>
            <h3> SRP helps you when &amp; where it matter most</h3>
            <p> Shelf Ready Packaging decreases handling times while increasing in-store sales. Thanks to clear signage, improved
                stackability, and strategically placed perforations, your products will make it to the shelves in record
                time.
            </p>
            <p> SRP doesn’t only make sure you’re there, it helps you present your product in full form. With free advertising
                space in the most relevant place you’ll be the envy of every marketeer.</p>

            <div class="fact">5-10% of your products are unavailable in stores right now. </div>

            <h3>The necessity of in-store marketing</h3>
            <p>Mere moments – that’s how long you have to convince prospective sweet-tooths. So if your brand is not immediately
                identifiable, your sales will never reach its full potential.</p>
            <p> Confectionary, sweet biscuits and snacks typically have a faster decision process than any other FMCG, so in-store
                marketing probably is nothing new for you.</p>
            <p>But what if you could take in-store marketing to the next level and stand out from your competition?</p>

            <h3>Displays that make you stand out</h3>
            <p>Corrugated Point of Sale (POS) and Point of Purchase (POP) displays grab consumers’ attention like no other and
                give you plenty of advertising room. Two-for-one – what’s not to like?</p>
            <p>Free standing display units, modular displays, standees or counter top displays? Our packaging strategists will
                work together with your marketing team to design and produce innovative displays for your products.</p>
            <p>Corrugated POS &amp; POP displays raise brand awareness, stimulate successful product launches and increase sales.

            <h2>Increase your supply chain efficiency</h2>
            <h3>Don’t do damaged goods</h3>
            <p>Production, transport or in-store – your products pass through so many containers and hands that the occasional
                damaged goods seem inevitable. The consequences of damaged products, however, should not be underestimated:
                lost sales, frustrated customers, and a weakened brand image will surely hurt your bottom line. Having trouble
                with lost goods? Time to up your packaging quality.</p>

            <h3>PACE: the quality sweet spot</h3>
            <p>Performance, assurance, consistent and environmental excellence – PACE, the new DS Smith golden standard, offers
                the full package.</p>
            <p>Through rigorous new testing methods, the assurance of high-quality raw materials and a strategic analysis of
                your entire supply chain, we can deliver packaging that dramatically decreases product damage and increases
                supply chain efficiency.</p>
